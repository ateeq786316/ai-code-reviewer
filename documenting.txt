Project: AI Code Reviewer
Overview
AI Code Reviewer is a full-stack web application that leverages AI to automatically review code snippets, providing actionable feedback, bug detection, suggestions, and a risk score for software developers. The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with integration of generative AI (Google Gemini) for code analysis.
Key Features
AI-Powered Code Review:
Users can paste code into the frontend, which is then sent to a backend API. The backend uses Google Gemini (or a mock if the API key is missing) to analyze the code and return:
Detected bugs
Security issues
Suggestions for improvement
A risk score (1â€“10)
Modern, Responsive UI:
The frontend is built with React and styled using CSS modules, providing a clean, modern, and responsive user experience.
Error Handling & Robustness:
The app gracefully handles errors from both the frontend and backend, displaying user-friendly messages if something goes wrong.
Flexible AI Integration:
If the AI API key is missing, the backend falls back to a mock response, ensuring the app remains functional for demos or development.
Extensible Backend:
The backend is structured with clear separation of concerns (routes, controllers, services), making it easy to extend with new features or integrate with other AI models.
GitHub Webhook Support:
The backend includes a route to handle GitHub webhooks, enabling automated code review for pull requests (fetches PR diffs and reviews them with AI).
Dark Themed, Visually Appealing Design:
Uses a dark color palette and can be customized with background images and overlays for a professional look.
What Makes It Stand Out
AI Integration:
Unlike static linters, this tool uses generative AI to provide context-aware, human-like code reviews, including reasoning and risk assessment.
User Experience:
The UI is intuitive, with clear feedback, loading states, and visually distinct cards for bugs, suggestions, and risk scores.
Developer Friendly:
The codebase is modular, well-organized, and uses modern best practices (async/await, error boundaries, CSS variables, etc.).
Demo-Ready:
The app works out-of-the-box with mock data if the AI API is not configured, making it easy to showcase.
Automation Ready:
GitHub webhook support means it can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated PR reviews.
Technical Stack
Frontend:
React (with hooks)
TypeScript (if enabled)
CSS Modules
Backend:
Node.js
Express.js
Integration with Google Gemini AI API
Webhook support for GitHub
Other:
Environment-based configuration (API keys, etc.)
Modular file structure for scalability
Example CV Bullet Points
Developed a full-stack AI-powered code review tool using React, Node.js, and Express, integrating Google Gemini for advanced code analysis and feedback.
Designed a modern, responsive UI with CSS modules and dark theme, supporting both manual and automated (GitHub webhook) code review workflows.
Implemented robust error handling and fallback mechanisms, ensuring seamless user experience even when external AI services are unavailable.
Engineered extensible backend architecture with clear separation of routes, controllers, and services, facilitating future enhancements and integrations.
